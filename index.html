    <p id="wiki">
        „<em>Steampunk</em> is a retrofuturistic subgenre of science fiction or science fantasy that incorporates
        technology and aesthetic designs inspired by 19th-century industrial steam-powered machinery. Although its
        literary origins are sometimes associated with the cyberpunk genre, steampunk works are often set in an
        alternative history of the 19th century British Victorian era or the American "Wild West", in a future during
        which steam power has maintained mainstream usage, or in a fantasy world that similarly employs steam power.
        However, steampunk and neo-Victorian are different in that the neo-Victorian movement does not extrapolate on
        technology while technology is a key aspect of steampunk.


    <p id="wiki"> <em>Steampunk</em> most recognizably features anachronistic technologies or retrofuturistic inventions as people
        in the
        19th century might have envisioned them, and is likewise rooted in the era's perspective on fashion, culture,
        architectural style, and art. Such technologies may include fictional machines like those found in the works of
        H. G. Wells and Jules Verne. Other examples of steampunk contain alternative-history-style presentations of such
        technology as steam cannons, lighter-than-air airships, analog computers, or such digital mechanical computers
        as Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine.</p>

    <p id="wiki"><em>Steampunk</em> may also incorporate additional elements from the genres of fantasy, horror, historical
        fiction,
        alternate history, or other branches of speculative fiction, making it often a hybrid genre.
        The first known appearance of the term steampunk was in 1987, though it now retroactively refers to many works
        of
        fiction created as far back as the 1950s or earlier A popular subgenre is Japanese steampunk, consisting of
        steampunk-themed manga and anime, with steampunk elements having appeared in mainstream manga since the 1940s.
    </p>
    <p id="wiki"><em>Steampunk</em> also refers to any of the artistic styles, clothing fashions, or subcultures that have
        developed from
        the aesthetics of steampunk fiction, Victorian-era fiction, art nouveau design, and films from the mid-20th
        century. Various modern utilitarian objects have been modded by individual artisans into a pseudo-Victorian
        mechanical "steampunk" style, and a number of visual and musical artists have been described as steampunk.”
